    "A few notes about this homework:\n",
    "1. This homework is purposefully heavy in using the Pandas package. Being able to explore data is an essential data science skill that you'll use throughout this class and your career -- even if the polling/politics application is not interesting to you. I encourage you to practice Pandas and learn how to use it well. Your code will NOT be graded on efficiency.\n",
    "2. Some of the questions can be interpreted in multiple ways. That is always true in data science. You'll need to make judgment calls for what analysis to do. For the homework, you'll still receive full points for any \"reasonable\" choice. Also feel free to ask questions on EdStem. "
